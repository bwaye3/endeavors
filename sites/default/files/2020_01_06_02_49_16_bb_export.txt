However, research tells a more complicated story. Those who remain crime free after prison, in general, have more positive attitudes about employment, get along better with their coworkers, and are more receptive to supervision than their re-offending peers. However, these qualities are not developed as a result of employment. They must be in place first.</p>\r\n<p>Punchy slogans like &ldquo;better off working&rdquo; and &ldquo;nothing stops a bullet like a job&rdquo; are quick to engage the popular imagination &ndash; however, evidence about what really works points in a different direction. Programming has to follow the research &mdash; providing the right service, in the right amount, at the right time, and in the right way. This includes helping former offenders to develop healthy thinking patterns, meaningful work trajectories, effective coping strategies, positive social engagement, and positive interpersonal relationships. And to do this effectively, it requires that they develop clarity about their deepest values and the habit of finding meaning in the moment.</p>","animate":"fadeIn","animate_delay":"0s","title":"To many people, the relationship between crime and employment..."},"editing":false,"element_name":"gva_text"},{"settings":{"content":"<h2>Our Framework</h2>\r\n<p>Our framework is based on 31 years of experience assisting former offenders to enter the workforce, mounting evidence about what drives crime, and nearly a century of research on the common factors impacting change efforts in counseling and training programs.
