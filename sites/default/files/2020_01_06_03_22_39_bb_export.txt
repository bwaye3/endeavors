Gone are the days when reentry programs provided a single intervention based on the personal opinions of their organizers.&nbsp; We know now that effective reentry programs must be tailored to the individual needs and specific realities of returning citizens.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>risk </strong>principle assumes that the intensity of services should match the relative risk to re-offend. This is true on both sides of the continuum. Too little help for those with a high risk to re-offend is damaging just as too much help for those with a low risk to re-offend.</li>\r\n<li>The <strong>needs </strong>principle assumes that certain needs correlate with criminal activity and others don&rsquo;t. For a program to have its intended impact it must prioritize each person&rsquo;s needs and address those first that are the most likely to contribute to future crime.</li>\r\n<li>The <strong>responsibility </strong>principle assumes what we have known for a long time in other disciplines &mdash; that everyone learns differently. To get the most out of a service, it needs to be adjusted for the learning style, motivation, and personal characteristics of each returning citizen. Responsivity makes a lot out of cognitive social learning models which we operationalize with peer specialists.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In many ways, these principles are common sense. However, in the course of trying to manage the sheer number of people under correctional supervision in America, an appetite for gaining efficiencies has dominated the industry &mdash; which has led to a multiplicity of &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; models. The risk, needs, responsivity model is both a recognition of the failures inherent in a conveyor-belt approach and a sign that the industry has begun to return to its senses.</p>","animate_delay":"0s"},"editing":false,"element_name":"gva_text"},{"settings":{"title":"5-Key Model","content":"<h2>5-Key Model</h2>\r\n<p>Increasingly, research focused on assessing reentry programs has tied their effectiveness to what has become known as the &ldquo;5-Key Model for Reentry.&rdquo; This approach emphasize elements of well-being for returning citizens in their programming &ndash; particularly, (a) meaningful work trajectories, (b) healthy thinking habits, (c) positive coping strategies, (d) positive social activities, and (e) positive social relationships.</p>","animate_delay":"0s"},"editing":false,"element_name":"gva_text"},{"settings":{"title":"Common Factors","content":"<h2>Common Factors</h2>\r\n<p>Nearly a century of research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of change programs has little to do with what distinguishes one approach from another.
