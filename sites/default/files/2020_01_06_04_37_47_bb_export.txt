By comparison, there are 7 halfway houses in Knoxville, 15 in Memphis, and 25 in Nashville, where there are also numerous nonprofit organizations dedicated to prison reentry as well as state-funded community resource centers and day reporting centers. I thought you might be interested in this and in the effort underway by Chattanooga Endeavors to correct this dangerous deficit and to reestablish our city as a national leader in what works in reentry services. You can learn more from the video and case document on the page for their Chattanooga Alliance Campaign at https://chattanoogaendeavors.org/alliance.
