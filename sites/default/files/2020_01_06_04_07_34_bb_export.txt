Reaching out to the wrong people could make things unnecessarily complicated as you&rsquo;re trying to rebuild your life. Ask yourself: Do they need to know? Do they have my best interest at heart? Can they help me to move on with my life? Your last call from prison should be to arrange a ride home and to let the person responsible for your shelter know to expect you soon.&nbsp; On your way home, make a list of your first contacts and and make sure to include:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Your immediate family members<br />&nbsp; Anyone you are required to report to<br />&nbsp; The few people who want you to stay out the most<br />&nbsp; The one person who will serve as your mentor and hold you accountable</p>\r\n<p>You might also want to make a second list of the people who want you back in the game the most &mdash; and make a concentrated effort to stay away from them.</p>\r\n<h3>Staying Connected</h3>\r\n<p>Connective technology is increasingly important in just about every area of our lives &mdash; including looking for services, finding employment opportunities, and filling out applications. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not hard to get connected for free in Chattanooga.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Get a library card and learn about their public computers<br />&nbsp; Visit the American Job Center and learn about their public computers<br />&nbsp; Order a free Lifeline phone <a href=\"http://www.lifelinesupport.org/ls\">www.lifelinesupport.org/ls</a><br />&nbsp; Set up a free Google account<br />&nbsp; Set up a free Google Voice account<br />&nbsp; Find out where there is free internet at <a href=\"http://www.chattanooga.gov/it/nooganet\">http://www.chattanooga.gov/it/nooganet</a></p>\r\n<p>We recommend Google because of its suite of free applications which can be helpful in your job search. Not only can you create and save documents, manage a calendar for appointments, and keep track of your contacts &mdash; but you can set up a free online phone with Google Voice. When you set up a Google Voice account, you will get a local phone number which you can keep indefinitely.&nbsp; You need a mobile phone to set it up. But a Lifeline phone will do. And once it&rsquo;s set up, you will always have a phone number with voicemail and texting.&nbsp; You just need to be connected to the internet and you can use Google Voice &mdash; even when you&rsquo;re out of&nbsp; minutes on your Lifeline phone.</p>\r\n<h3>Identification</h3>\r\n<p>Gather all your identification and apply for replacements as needed. For employment purposes, you will need a Social Security Card and a State Issued Picture ID. To learn what other identification can be used for employment, get in touch with the&nbsp;American Job Center in Chattanooga.&nbsp; You should have the original or a legal replacement of all of the following identifications which you are eligible for:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Birth Certificate<br />&nbsp; Social Security Card (not laminated)<br />&nbsp; Driver License (reinstatement information can be found at <a href=\"https://dl.safety.tn.gov/\">https://dl.safety.tn.gov</a>)<br />&nbsp; State Issued Picture ID (if you are ineligible for a Driver License at this time)<br />&nbsp; Veteran ID Card<br />&nbsp; Proof of Citizenship<br />&nbsp; Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood</p>\r\n<p>Getting replacement identification can be tricky. If you need help, get in touch with 211 First Call for Help and ask for information about agencies that provide transportation and monetary assistance for identification.</p>\r\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\r\n<p>You can get most of the clothing you need by calling the thrifts stores listed in this resource directory, explaining that you just got out of prison and asking if they are able to help you with free clothes. Call around until you have identified places to go for the following:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Casual shoes<br />&nbsp; Work shoes<br />&nbsp; First change of clothes (casual)<br />&nbsp; Second change of clothes (work)<br />&nbsp; Third change of clothes (interview)<br />&nbsp; Fourth change of clothes (religious service)<br />&nbsp; Jacket appropriate for the season</p>\r\n<h3>Short Material List</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want to be very clear about the things you need to purchase first to be ready for your next step. Start with the list below and add to it according to your circumstances. This will help you to prioritize how to spend the limited money you have. And, if people you meet want to give you a hand because you just got out of prison, you&rsquo;ll know what to ask them for.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Bus pass (2-3 months)<br />&nbsp; Money for identifications<br />&nbsp; Pocket cash for job search<br />&nbsp; Watch<br />&nbsp; Wallet<br />&nbsp; Alarm clock<br />&nbsp; Pens<br />&nbsp; Pads of paper<br />&nbsp; Pocket calendar<br />&nbsp; Pocket notebook<br />&nbsp; Gym bag<br />&nbsp; Umbrella<br />&nbsp; Haircut<br />&nbsp; Toiletries<br />&nbsp; Underwear<br />&nbsp; Socks<br />&nbsp; Wal-Mart gift card (for clothing and other miscellaneous items)</p>\r\n<h3>Human Services &amp; Community Support</h3>\r\n<p>Just because you&rsquo;re a former offender doesn&rsquo;t mean you qualify&nbsp;only for services intended for former offenders. You are also part of the general public. And there are many services which are open to the general public and don&rsquo;t discriminate on the basis of a criminal cconviction. You should make a list of the services you would benefit from and call 211 First Call for Help to see what is available.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Make appointments with services found through First Call for Help<br />&nbsp; Apply for SNAP at Department of Human Services<br />&nbsp; Apply to reinstate VA, SSI, SSDI, Medicaid, Medicare, and other benefits<br />&nbsp; If you owe Child Support, get in touch with the court. Don&rsquo;t wait<br />&nbsp; If you are taking prescription medication, get in touch with Homeless Healthcare<br />&nbsp; Review the list of support groups and start attending as appropriate<br />&nbsp; Connect with your religious community and get involved. Don&rsquo;t ask for help.</p>\r\n<h3>Employment &amp; Education</h3>\r\n<p>If you would like to get a college degree, now is the time to do it. You will be eligible for more financial aid immediately after you&rsquo;re released from prison than you will during the years after you start earning money. Plus nothing convinces an employer that you can be trusted more than earning degree after release. And you&rsquo;ll be eligible for higher paying jobs.
